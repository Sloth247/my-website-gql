          Hi ðŸ‘‹ there, I&apos;m Yuko Horita and thanks for visiting my website.
          I am a self-taught web developer that loves improving my skills. I
          also pay a lot of attention to detail in all my work. I always
          priotize the accessiblity of the things I build so that the internet
          is open to everyone, I consider my strengths to be flexibility and
          being eager to take on new challenges and take on targets set by
          clients.
